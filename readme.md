This project is about building NLP model that detects spam SMS text messages and because it's not fun at all to just build a model and forget about it as 90% of ML models in the world ,I'll be the exception :wink: and I'll deploy my model into an MLOps platform 
## Plan 
- create an NLP model that detects spam SMS text messages
- deploy our model into the Algorithmia platform
- use your deployed NLP model in any Python application.

# 1. Build the ML Model
